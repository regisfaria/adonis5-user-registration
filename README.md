# Adonis 5 - User Registration

## Overview
This is a quick project using the new Adonis 5, meant for testing this framework, in a simple way.

I've setup a SQLite connection database and left one **"routes-insomnia.json"** file with the routes of this app.

It features **two routes**, one **POST** for user registration and **GET** to list all created users.

The documentation can be consulted [here](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/introduction).

## Instalation & Running
Simply install it with **npm** or **yarn**.

Run the migrations with:
```shell
node ace migration:run
```

You can run the project with the "dev" script located in the "package.json" file.
